# US States Median House Hold Incomen & Foreign Born Percentage 2018

This report was created with Python.

The study takes median house hold income from 2018 from each state of the US and the District of Columbia. The study also takes the percentage of foreign born residents in each US state and DC from 2018. The scatter plot and the regression line suggests that as the more cosmopolitan a state is then the median household income is likely to be higher. 

The study suggests a correlation more study is needed to prove a definite causation. The possible reason for higher income is a concentration of human capital that facilitates more economic production. There seems to be population multiplier effect that increases economic productivity. States that are more parochial seems to have lower median household income because the lesser the population does not permit for as much collaboration and concentration of talent.
